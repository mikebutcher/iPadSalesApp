Mike,

Attached is the pdf version of the paperwork.  The password is WATER.

Here is how the paperwork flows:

1.  Once a salesperson gets a new account they fill out the attached paperwork - both the contract portfolio and the contract calculation sheet.  The customer signs on page #1, schedule 19 (last page in portfolio) and the field service order.

2.  Sometimes a current customer orders equipment, chemicals or extra service.   We use a FSO to order this.  I have attached an example from FTE.

3.  This paperwork is either faxed or scanned and emailed into the office.

4.  Once this reaches the office Robin sets up a customer profile (example attached.)

5.  Brad sets up an ereport and schedules service.

Thanks again.  I have a meeting at 9 am.  Will 10:30 am work?
